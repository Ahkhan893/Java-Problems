//Cached Thread Pool
//A Cached Thread Pool creates new threads as needed but reuses previously constructed threads when they are available.
//If a thread is idle for a certain period, it is terminated and removed from the pool. This type of pool is typically
//        used for handling a large number of short-lived asynchronous tasks.
//
//Key Characteristics:
//
//Threads are created as needed and reused if idle threads are available.
//
//If threads are idle for 60 seconds, they are terminated.
//
//        Ideal for handling many tasks that are short-lived.
//
//        Dynamic: The number of threads can grow and shrink based on demand.
//
//Use Case:
//Best for executing a large number of short tasks where you donâ€™t need to limit the number of threads.
