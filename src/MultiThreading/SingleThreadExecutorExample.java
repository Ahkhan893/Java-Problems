// Single Thread Executor
//The SingleThreadExecutor ensures that tasks are executed sequentially,
//using a single worker thread. This is useful when you need to guarantee that tasks are executed in a specific order and that only one task runs at a time.
//
//Key Characteristics:
//
//It always uses a single worker thread.
//
//If the thread is busy, the tasks are queued up until the thread is free.
//
//The tasks are executed in the order they were submitted.
//
//Use Case: Suitable for situations where tasks must be executed sequentially,
//and you donâ€™t need parallel execution. For example, logging, database transactions, etc.
